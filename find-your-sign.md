  <b>Description</b>: Scuta are known as the protectors. Despite their tough exterior, the loyalty and strength of a Scutum makes it well worth the effort to get to know one. Scuta are often warm and welcoming once you get past their external barriers. Given their stubbornness, Scuta are driven to scheme for their success, often coming up with surprising solutions to difficult problems. Scutum individuals have the most difficulty relating to Eriadanus and Volans, though they get along well with Hercules and Lepus. <br /><br />

  <b>Description</b>: Eridani are known for their out-going and extroverted nature. Eridani are bright-eyed with a strong sense of adventure. They follow the beat of their own drum, which can be their greatest strength but also make it hard for some to relate to them. Eridani love to talk but can sometimes come off as a little overbearing. They usually hit it off with Volans and clash with Hercules.  <br /><br />
